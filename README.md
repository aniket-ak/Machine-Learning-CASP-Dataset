**Machine Learning Tutorial using Physicochemical Properties of Protein Tertiary Structure Data Set**

The workflow followed here is adapted from the book [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow](https://g.co/kgs/bvvihi) by **AurÃ©lien Geron**.

*The dataset is downloaded from this link [Physicochemical Properties of Protein Tertiary Structure Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Physicochemical+Properties+of+Protein+Tertiary+Structure).* 

*The tutorial is divided into three sections:*
> 1. *Data preprocessing. Explore the dataset for statistical attributes*
> 2. *Fit a linear model and evaluate performance*
> 3. *Project the feature space onto a reduced one with at least 99% of variance preserved*
> 4. *Fit a linear model on the reduced features and evaluate performance*
