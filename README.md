## Overview
**Machine Learning for prediction of the RMSD (Root Mean Square Deviation) of a decoy set using Physicochemical Properties of Protein Tertiary Structure Data Set**

The workflow followed here is adapted from the book [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow](https://g.co/kgs/bvvihi) by **Aur√©lien Geron**.

## Project details

**Scope of this work** : To layout the Machine Learning workflow from start to end. 

**Target Audience** : This piece of work is intended for someone with minimal knowledge in machine learning practices. This is not a tutorial for an absolute beginner.

## Dependencies

**Requirements** : ScikitLearn, Numpy, Matplotlib and Pandas (see attached `requirements.txt` file for the complete list)

*The dataset is downloaded from this link [Physicochemical Properties of Protein Tertiary Structure Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Physicochemical+Properties+of+Protein+Tertiary+Structure).* 

## Content Organization

*This notebook is divided into two sections:*
1. **Data preprocessing** *- Explore the dataset and prepare it before regression*
2. **Model selection, training and fine tuning** *- Try with various models, compare their performance and fine tune them*
